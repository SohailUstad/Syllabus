      <div class="lead">
        When you compile the Hello.java file then the compiler creates a .class
        file .class file is created with the name Hello.class Hello.class
        contains byte codes <br /><br />
        Byte code (.class file) is specialized set of instruction that JVM can
        read. Thus this .class file consisting of byte code can be transported
        to other system, irrespective of the operating system it has, and could
        be executed comfortably without any issue. This is what makes java a
        portable language. Because of the same reason java is also popularly
        known as Write once, run anywhere (WORA) language. <br /><br />
        JVM is capable of reading, verifying the bytecode. Any computer system
        on which JVM is installed will be capable of executing the compiled
        .class file (consisting of bytecode).
        <br /><br />
        During run or execution time following tasks are performed within JVM:
        Class loader loads the .class files containing bytecode to the memory.
        Next the bytecode is verified and checked for any errors or bugs which
        may result in program exhibiting anamolous behaviour. At last the
        just-in-time compiler converts the bytecode into machine code.
